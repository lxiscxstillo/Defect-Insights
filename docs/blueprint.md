# **App Name**: Defect Insights

## Core Features:

- Descriptive Statistics: Display summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, range, min, max) for selected defect data categories.
- AI-Driven Insights: Use a tool to interpret results of the statistical analyses to suggest probable defect reduction strategies and process improvements.
- Monte Carlo Simulation Visualizer: Visually compare total repair cost distribution scenarios after simulated defect reductions (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%) with boxplots.
- CSV Data Import and Display: Enable upload of manufacturing defect data via CSV file, automatically parsed and displayed in a tabular format.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and analytical focus.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECEFF1) for a clean, modern, and non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight interactive elements and key insights, providing a fresh contrast to the primary blue.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts such as Open Sans or Roboto for clear readability in data tables and analysis summaries.
- Use minimalist icons from libraries like Material Icons to represent different defect types and analysis functions.
- Dashboard layout with clear separation of data tables, visualizations, and analysis results using cards and grid structures.
- Subtle transition animations for loading data and updating visualizations to provide a smooth user experience.
